# Game Analysis Project

## Overview
Welcome to the Game Analysis project repository! In this project, I dive into the world of gaming analytics using SQL queries and data analysis tools. Here, I explored player behaviors, level dynamics, and gameplay trends to optimize gaming experiences and drive engagement.

## Project Files
- **Game_Analysis.sql**: SQL script containing queries for analyzing player and level details.
- **Problem Statement - Game Analysis.pdf**: Document outlining our project's objectives, methodologies, and findings related to game analysis.
- **README.md**: Detailed documentation providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
- **level_details2.csv**: CSV file containing detailed information about game levels.
- **player_details.csv**: CSV file containing player demographic and gameplay data.

## Project Structure
- **data/**: Directory for storing additional datasets or backups used in our analyses.
- **scripts/**: Contains SQL scripts for database management, data extraction, and analysis.
- **reports/**: Contains exported reports or additional documents generated from our analysis tools for sharing insights externally.
- **README.md**: Comprehensive guide providing an overview of our project, setup instructions, and guidance on utilizing SQL scripts and data files.

## Setup Instructions
To replicate and extend our Game Analysis project locally:
1. Import `level_details2.csv` and `player_details.csv` into your database management system (if applicable).
2. Execute queries from `Game_Analysis.sql` to perform data analysis tasks.
3. Review the `Problem Statement - Game Analysis.pdf` for detailed project objectives and methodologies.
4. Refer to our `README.md` file and project documentation for setup instructions, SQL script usage, and data file integration.

## Usage
- Utilize SQL scripts to explore player behaviors, level dynamics, and gameplay trends.
- Use insights derived from our analysis to optimize game mechanics, improve player engagement, and enhance overall gameplay experiences.
- Export reports or visualizations for sharing insights with stakeholders or incorporating into presentations and reports.
